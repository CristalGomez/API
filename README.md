# API
The purpose of this web-app is to showcase my use of an API call and AJAX. This web-app was made with:
1. HTML/ CSS
1. jQuery
1. GIPHY API
1. Materialize

## How-To
Users can search up any gif using the GIPHY API. They can do this by typing in what they want to search for in the input box & clicking "add gif". Once they have added the gif, they can click on the gif they wish to view, and a max of 10 gifs will prepend to the page. If the user clicks on another button, ten new gifs will prepend, without the previous ones going away.

The user is protected from submiting a blank response by a toast that notifies them that the input box cannot be left empty.

The user also recieves a rating for the gif which is determined by GIPHY.
